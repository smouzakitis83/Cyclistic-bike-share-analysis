# Project Background
Cyclistic, established in 2016, launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.

The company has significant amounts of data on its geotracked bicycles that are locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

* **Activity Trends Analysis:** Evaluation of historical activity patterns, highlighting the average of activity within the hours of the day, days of the week and months of the year.

  # Executive Summary
My analysis indicates that members exhibit peak activity within a 30-minute timeframe. We also observe significant activity spikes corresponding to average hourly, daily, and monthly intervals. The high volume of traffic during business hours suggests that membership offers a clear benefit to customers commuting to work. Therefore, advertising campaigns targeting the months of May through July would be advantageous for the company. Strategically placing advertisements in locations where current members are employed could effectively encourage their colleagues to subscribe to memberships. Additionally, offering a weekend pass could attract casual riders who may not be interested in a long-term commitment.
